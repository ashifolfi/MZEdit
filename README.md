# MZEdit
An Open-Source Godot Based editor for RPG Maker MZ Projects.

**MZEdit CANNOT EDIT BUILT GAMES. YOU MUST HAVE THE ORIGINAL PROJECT FILES.**

You **must own a copy of RPG Maker MZ to create new projects**. MZEdit does not come with any assets for any new projects.

MZEdit is an experimental project not meant for usage in actual production environments. It is a pet project created out of curiosity of if doing it was possible. It also provides an example of how to work with RPG Maker MZ data for others who might want to create tools that interact with said data.
